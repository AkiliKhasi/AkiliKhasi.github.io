### [Link](https://github.com/AkiliKhasi/CompareList) Report Failed Backups

Our backup software would send daily reports as a PDF for every customer and their corresponding DR site. In order for a manager to see if a report had not been run for a specific customer they would have to sort through a list of over 150 PDF files to see if it was missing. In order to make this process more efficient I wrote this script to compare all of the PDF files generated that day against a control list and then list any missing reports in a text file.
